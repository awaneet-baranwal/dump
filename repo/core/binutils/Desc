gprof:Displays call graph profile data
ld:A linker that combines a number of object and archive files into a single file, relocating their data and tying up symbol references
ld.gold:A cut down version of ld that only supports the elf object file format
ld.bfd:Hard link to ld
nm:Lists the symbols occurring in a given object file
objcopy:Translates one type of object file into another
objdump:Displays information about the given object file, with options controlling the particular information to display; the information shown is useful to programmers who are working on the compilation tools

readelf:Displays information about ELF type binaries
size:Lists the section sizes and the total size for the given object files
strings:Outputs, for each given file, the sequences of printable characters that are of at least the specified length (defaulting to four); for object files, it prints, by default, only the strings from the initializing and loading sections while for other types of files, it scans the entire file
strip:Discards symbols from object files
libbfd:The Binary File Descriptor library
libopcodes:A library for dealing with opcodes—the “readable text” versions of instructions for the processor; it is used for building utilities like objdump
