bunzip2:Decompresses bzipped files
bzcat:Decompresses to standard output
bzcmp:Runs cmp on bzipped files
bzdiff:Runs diff on bzipped files
bzegrep:Runs egrep on bzipped files
bzfgrep:Runs fgrep on bzipped files
bzgrep:Runs grep on bzipped files
bzip2:Compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block sorting text compression algorithm with Huffman coding; the compression rate is better than that achieved by more conventional compressors using “Lempel-Ziv” algorithms, like gzip
bzip2recover:Tries to recover data from damaged bzipped files
bzless:Runs less on bzipped files
bzmore:Runs more on bzipped files
